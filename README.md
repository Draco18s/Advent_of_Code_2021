*Started late on day 1...as usual...*

*Started late on day 4 due to travel*

*Day 5 all of the little things*

*Day 7 site wigged out and I locked myself out of answering part 2 because I thought it hadn't taken my answer for part 1.*
*Site did wig out, could not fetch personal stats.*

*Day 11: beat both Stevie-O and Keith...oh they were at a party*

*Day 12: stupidly kept track of all paths found, rather than just counting them.*

*Day 11: beat both Stevie-O and Keith*

*Day 15: part 2 required four attempts before computing the total cost to reach every tile. Gross. Execution time: 12.340 seconds.*

*Day 17: tore out my hair trying to figure out why my regex wasn't working. I was feeding it day 16's input. Did not find the elegant solution to part 1.*
